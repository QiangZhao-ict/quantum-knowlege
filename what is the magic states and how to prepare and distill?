In universal quantum computation, there are two kinds of quantum gates required, clifford gates and not-clifford gates. The clifford gates are spanned by four Pauli gates, which are I,X,Y,Z, respectively. Namely, the eigenstates of clliford gates are the linear combinations of eigenstates of pauli gates. Hence, the clifford gates can be used to implement very easily, and the fault-tolerant quantum gates are  achieved by transerval gates. However, the non-clifford gates are very intractable to complement, especially for fault-tolerant computing. A optimal solution to solve the question is to implement non-clliford gates through the magic states. That is to say, we use magic states to do quantum computing that non-clifford gates can be used to implement. The non-clifford gate T can be complemented by magic state, as following figure.
